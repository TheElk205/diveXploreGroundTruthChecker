A note regarding query 674: Find shots of a parachutist descending
towards a field on the ground in the daytime

In assessing this query by annotators, it seems that assessors were
more liberal and didn't take into account the satisfaction of all query
conditions to determine if the shot can be judged as relevant (true positive)
or non-relevant (false positive). Thus in the provided ground truth file
(avs.qrels.main.tv21) there can be shots that include a parachutist but
not necessarily descending, or perhaps the field or ground not visible, etc.
Thus systems should be more careful when applying this ground truth as
training data for this query.
We apologize for this inconvenience and thanks for understanding.
